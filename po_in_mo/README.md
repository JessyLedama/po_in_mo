## Adding the PO in the MO
This module introduces some changes to the Manufacturing module and Sales Module. In Manufacturing, you can choose some products for which a Purchase Order must be included in the Manufacturing Order. When you select the PO, the system computes the total in the PO and adds it to the Quantity (product_qty) of the MO.

## Adding Number Plate to the PO
It also adds a Number Plate field in the PO and MO, to keep track of the vehicle that brought in the stock. This brings full visibility to the production line. You can track the raw material to the vehicle that brought it and the day. 
When a PO has a number plate entered, it is imported into the MO associated with that PO.
